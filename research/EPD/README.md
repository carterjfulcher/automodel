# [ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1061219&owner=exclude)

Enterprise (EPD) is a limited partnership that specializes in the
sale and delivery of commodities including natural gas, crude oil,
petrochemical, and other refined products. Several attributes of
EPD are appealing to investors, such as their generous `7.3%` dividend
(as of 3/5/23), of which has increased year over year since their inception
in 1968:

EPD also allows investors to have exposure to the commodities while limiting
some of the volatility and downside risk. Many investors believe EPD to be
a primarily midstream company, however, according to their most recent 10K
filing, EPD makes approximately 88% of it's revenue from the sale of commodities
themselves:
